There are so many plugins on the great [awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) page that
it makes sense to filter them out and also to **score** them. The plugins below
contain 50 or more commits and are **evaluated** by an automatic script in order
to detect:
 - ones with 100 or more commits
 - active ones
 - very active ones
 - maintained ones
 - ones having an ongoing research & development

Just take a look at the iconography. It's intuitive and easy to memorize. In
minutes you'll be able to grep interesting plugins with your eyes!
