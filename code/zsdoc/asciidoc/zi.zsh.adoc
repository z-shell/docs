:zi-reload-and-run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 Marks given function ($3) for autoloading, and executes it triggering the load.
 $1 is the fpath dedicated  to the function, $2 are autoload options. This function replaces "autoload -X",
 because using that on older Zsh versions causes problems with traps.
 
 So basically one creates function stub that calls :zi-reload-and-run() instead of "autoload -X".
 
 $1 - FPATH dedicated to function
 $2 - autoload options
 $3 - function name (one that needs autoloading)

@zi-scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 Searches for timeout tasks, executes them. There's an array of tasks
 waiting for execution, this scheduler manages them, detects which ones
 should be run at current moment, decides to remove (or not) them from
 the array after execution.
 
 $1 - if "following", then it is non-first (second and more)
 invocation of the scheduler; this results in chain of `sched'
 invocations that results in repetitive @zi-scheduler activity.
 
 if "burst", then all tasks are marked timeout and executed one
 by one; this is handy if e.g. a docker image starts up and
 needs to install all turbo-mode plugins without any hesitation
 (delay), i.e. "burst" allows to run package installations from
 script, not from prompt.

 zicdclear

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

zicdreplay
~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 A function that can be invoked from within `atinit', `atload', etc. ice-mod.
 It works like `zi cdreplay', which cannot be invoked from such hook ices.

 zicdreplay

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

zicompdef

____
 
 ]]]
 Stores compdef for a replay with `zicdreplay' (turbo mode) or with `zi cdreplay' (normal mode).
 An utility function of an undefined use case.
____

Has 1 line(s). Doesn't call other functions.

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

zicompinit
~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 ]]]
 A function that can be invoked from within `atinit', `atload', etc. ice-mod.
 It runs `autoload compinit; compinit' and respects
 ZI[ZCOMPDUMP_PATH] and ZI[COMPINIT_OPTS].
____

Uses feature(s): _autoload_, _compinit_

Not called by script or any function (may be e.g. a hook, a Zle widget, etc.).

zicompinit_fast
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 ]]]
 Checking the cached .zcompdump file to see if it must be regenerated adds a noticable delay to zsh startup.
 This restricts checking it once a day, determines when to regenerate, as compinit doesn't always need to
 modify the compdump and compiles mapped to share (total mem reduction) run in background in multiple shells.
 A function that can be invoked from within `atinit', `atload'

add-zsh-hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 Add to HOOK the given FUNCTION.
 HOOK is one of chpwd, precmd, preexec, periodic, zshaddhistory,
 zshexit, zsh_directory_name (the _functions subscript is not required).
 
 With -d, remove the function from the hook instead; delete the hook
 variable if it is empty.
 
 -D behaves like -d, but pattern characters are active in the
 function name, so any matching function will be deleted from the hook.

compinit
~~~~~~~~

____
 
 Initialisation for new style completion. This mainly contains some helper
 functions and setup. Everything else is split into different files that
 will automatically be made autoloaded (see the end of this file).  The
 names of the files that will be considered for autoloading are those that
 begin with an underscores (like `_condition).
 
 The first line of each of these files is read and must indicate what
 should be done with its contents:
 
 `#compdef <names ...>'

is-at-least
~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 
 Test whether $ZSH_VERSION (or some value of your choice, if a second argument
 is provided) is greater than or equal to x.y.z-r (in argument one). In fact,
 it'll accept any dot/dash-separated string of numbers as its second argument
 and compare it to the dot/dash-separated first argument. Leading non-number
 parts of a segment (such as the "zefram" in 3.1.2-zefram4) are not considered
 when the comparison is done; only the numbers matter. Any left-out segments
 in the first argument that are present in the version string compared are
 considered as zeroes, eg 3 == 3.0 == 3.0.0 == 3.0.0.0 and so on.
