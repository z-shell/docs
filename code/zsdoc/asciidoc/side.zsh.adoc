.zi-compute-ice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 FUNCTION: .zi-compute-ice [[[
 Computes ICE array (default, it can be specified via $3) from a) input ICE, b) static ice, c) saved ice,
 taking priorities into account. Also returns path to snippet directory and optional name of snippet file
 (only valid if ICE[svn] is not set).
 
 Can also pack resulting ices into ZI_SICE (see $2).
 
 $1 - URL (also plugin-spec)
 $2 - "pack" or "nopack" or "pack-nf" - packing means ICE
 wins with static ice; "pack-nf" means that disk-ices will
 be ignored (no-file?)
 $3 - name of output associative array, "ICE" is the default
 $4 - name of output string parameter, to hold path to directory ("local_dir")
 $5 - name of output string parameter, to hold filename ("filename")
 $6 - name of output string parameter, to hold is-snippet 0/1-bool ("is_snippet")

.zi-first
~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 FUNCTION: .zi-first [[[
 Finds the main file of plugin. There are multiple file name formats, they are ordered in order starting from more correct
 ones, and matched. .zi-load-plugin() has similar code parts and doesn't call .zi-first() – for performance. Obscure matching
 is done in .zi-find-other-matches, here and in .zi-load(). Obscure = non-standard main-file naming convention.
 
 $1 - plugin spec (4 formats: user---plugin, user/plugin, user, plugin)
 $2 - plugin (only when $1 - i.e. user - given)

.zi-store-ices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 FUNCTION: .zi-store-ices [[[
 Saves ice mods in given hash onto disk.
 
 $1 - directory where to create / delete files
 $2 - name of hash that holds values
 $3 - additional keys of hash to store, space separated
 $4 - additional keys of hash to store, empty-meaningful ices, space separated
 $5 - the URL, if applicable
 $6 - the mode (1 - svn, 0 - single file), if applicable

.zi-two-paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 FUNCTION: .zi-two-paths [[[
 Obtains a snippet URL without specification if it is an SVN URL (points to directory) or regular URL (points to file),
 returns 2 possible paths for further examination
____

Has 22 line(s). Calls functions:

zmv
~~~

____
 
 function zmv {
 zmv, zcp, zln:
 
 This is a multiple move based on zsh pattern matching.  To get the full
 power of it, you need a postgraduate degree in zsh.  However, simple
 tasks work OK, so if that's all you need, here are some basic examples:
 zmv '(*).txt' '$1.lis'
 Rename foo.txt to foo.lis, etc.  The parenthesis is the thing that
 gets replaced by the $1 (not the `*', as happens in mmv, and note the
 `$', not `=', so that you need to quote both words).
____

Has 299 line(s). Doesn't call other functions.

Uses feature(s): _eval_, _getopts_, _read_, _setopt_
