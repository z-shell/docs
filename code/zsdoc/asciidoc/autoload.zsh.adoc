is-at-least
~~~~~~~~~~~

____
 
 
 Test whether $ZSH_VERSION (or some value of your choice, if a second argument
 is provided) is greater than or equal to x.y.z-r (in argument one). In fact,
 it'll accept any dot/dash-separated string of numbers as its second argument
 and compare it to the dot/dash-separated first argument. Leading non-number
 parts of a segment (such as the "zefram" in 3.1.2-zefram4) are not considered
 when the comparison is done; only the numbers matter. Any left-out segments
 in the first argument that are present in the version string compared are
 considered as zeroes, eg 3 == 3.0 == 3.0.0 == 3.0.0.0 and so on.
