# Test whether $ZSH_VERSION (or some value of your choice, if a second argument
# is provided) is greater than or equal to x.y.z-r (in argument one). In fact,
# it'll accept any dot/dash-separated string of numbers as its second argument
# and compare it to the dot/dash-separated first argument. Leading non-number
# parts of a segment (such as the "zefram" in 3.1.2-zefram4) are not considered
# when the comparison is done; only the numbers matter. Any left-out segments
# in the first argument that are present in the version string compared are
# considered as zeroes, eg 3 == 3.0 == 3.0.0 == 3.0.0.0 and so on.
