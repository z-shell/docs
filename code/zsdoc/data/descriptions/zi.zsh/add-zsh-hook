# Add to HOOK the given FUNCTION.
# HOOK is one of chpwd, precmd, preexec, periodic, zshaddhistory,
# zshexit, zsh_directory_name (the _functions subscript is not required).
#
# With -d, remove the function from the hook instead; delete the hook
# variable if it is empty.
#
# -D behaves like -d, but pattern characters are active in the
# function name, so any matching function will be deleted from the hook.
