# FUNCTION: :zi-reload-and-run. [[[
# Marks given function ($3) for autoloading, and executes it triggering the load.
# $1 is the fpath dedicated  to the function, $2 are autoload options. This function replaces "autoload -X",
# because using that on older Zsh versions causes problems with traps.
#
# So basically one creates function stub that calls :zi-reload-and-run() instead of "autoload -X".
#
# $1 - FPATH dedicated to function
# $2 - autoload options
# $3 - function name (one that needs autoloading)
