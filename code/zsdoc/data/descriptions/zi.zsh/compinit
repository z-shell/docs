# Initialisation for new style completion. This mainly contains some helper
# functions and setup. Everything else is split into different files that
# will automatically be made autoloaded (see the end of this file).  The
# names of the files that will be considered for autoloading are those that
# begin with an underscores (like `_condition).
#
# The first line of each of these files is read and must indicate what
# should be done with its contents:
#
#   `#compdef <names ...>'
