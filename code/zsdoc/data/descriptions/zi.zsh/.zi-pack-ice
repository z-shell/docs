# FUNCTION: .zi-pack-ice. [[[
# Remembers all ice-mods, assigns them to concrete plugin. Ice spec is in general forgotten for
# second-next command (that's why it's called "ice" - it melts), however they glue to the object (plugin
# or snippet) mentioned in the next command â€“ for later use with e.g. `zi update ...'.
