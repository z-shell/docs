# FUNCTION: @zi-scheduler. [[[
# Searches for timeout tasks, executes them. There's an array of tasks
# waiting for execution, this scheduler manages them, detects which ones
# should be run at current moment, decides to remove (or not) them from
# the array after execution.
#
# $1 - if "following", then it is non-first (second and more)
#      invocation of the scheduler; this results in chain of `sched'
#      invocations that results in repetitive @zi-scheduler activity.
#
#      if "burst", then all tasks are marked timeout and executed one
#      by one; this is handy if e.g. a docker image starts up and
#      needs to install all turbo-mode plugins without any hesitation
#      (delay), i.e. "burst" allows to run package installations from
#      script, not from prompt.
