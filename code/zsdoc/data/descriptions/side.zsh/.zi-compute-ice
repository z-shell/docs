# FUNCTION: .zi-compute-ice [[[
# Computes ICE array (default, it can be specified via $3) from a) input ICE, b) static ice, c) saved ice,
# taking priorities into account. Also returns path to snippet directory and optional name of snippet file
# (only valid if ICE[svn] is not set).
#
# Can also pack resulting ices into ZI_SICE (see $2).
#
# $1 - URL (also plugin-spec)
# $2 - "pack" or "nopack" or "pack-nf" - packing means ICE
#      wins with static ice; "pack-nf" means that disk-ices will
#      be ignored (no-file?)
# $3 - name of output associative array, "ICE" is the default
# $4 - name of output string parameter, to hold path to directory ("local_dir")
# $5 - name of output string parameter, to hold filename ("filename")
# $6 - name of output string parameter, to hold is-snippet 0/1-bool ("is_snippet")
