# function zmv {
# zmv, zcp, zln:

# This is a multiple move based on zsh pattern matching.  To get the full
# power of it, you need a postgraduate degree in zsh.  However, simple
# tasks work OK, so if that's all you need, here are some basic examples:
#   zmv '(*).txt' '$1.lis'
# Rename foo.txt to foo.lis, etc.  The parenthesis is the thing that
# gets replaced by the $1 (not the `*', as happens in mmv, and note the
# `$', not `=', so that you need to quote both words).
