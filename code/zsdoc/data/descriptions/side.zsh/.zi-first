# FUNCTION: .zi-first [[[
# Finds the main file of plugin. There are multiple file name formats, they are ordered in order starting from more correct
# ones, and matched. .zi-load-plugin() has similar code parts and doesn't call .zi-first() â€“ for performance. Obscure matching
# is done in .zi-find-other-matches, here and in .zi-load(). Obscure = non-standard main-file naming convention.
#
# $1 - plugin spec (4 formats: user---plugin, user/plugin, user, plugin)
# $2 - plugin (only when $1 - i.e. user - given)
