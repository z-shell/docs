This document has been created after 3.5 years of creating software for Z shell
and receiving help from IRC channel #zsh. Avoiding forks was the main guideline
when creating the projects and this lead to multiple discoveries of Zsh constructs
that are fast, robust, and do not depend on external tools. Such code is more like
Ruby or Perl code, less like top-down shell scripts.

## Information

[#at-sign-about-keeping-array-form]
### @ is about keeping array form

How to access all array elements in a shell? The standard answer: `use @
subscript`, i.e. `${array[@]}`. However, this is the Bash & Ksh way (and with
the option `KSH_ARRAYS`, Zsh also works this way, i.e. needs `@` to access
the whole array). Z shell **is different**: it is `$array` that refers to all
elements anyway. There is no need for the `@` subscript.

So what use has `@` in the Zsh-world? It is: "`keep array form`" or "`do not
join`".  When is it activated? When the user quotes the array, i.e. invokes
`"$array"`, he induces *joining* of all array elements (into a single string).
`@` is to have elements still quoted (so empty elements are
preserved), but not joined.

Two forms are available, `"$array[@]"` and `"${(@)array}"`. The first form has
an additional effect – when option `KSH_ARRAYS` is set, it indeed induces
referencing to the whole array instead of a first element only. It should then use
braces, i.e. `${array[@]}`, `"${array[@]}"` (`KSH_ARRAYS` requirement).

In practice, if you'll use `@` as a subscript – `[@]`, not as a flag –
`${(@)...}`, then you'll make the code `KSH_ARRAYS`-compatible.

[#extended-glob]
### extended_glob

Glob-flags `#b` and `#m` require `setopt extended_glob`. Patterns utilizing `~`
and `^` also require it. Extended-glob is one of the main features of Zsh.

## Constructs

[#reading-a-file]
### Reading a file

[source,zsh]
----
declare -a lines; lines=( "${(@f)"$(<path/file)"}" )
----

This preserves empty lines because of double-quoting (the outside one).
`@`-flag is used to obtain an array instead of a scalar. If you don't want empty
lines preserved, you can also skip `@`-splitting, as is explained in
Information section:

[source,zsh]
----
declare -a lines; lines=( ${(f)"$(<path/file)"} )
----

Note: `$(<...)` construct strips trailing empty lines.

[#reading-from-stdin]
### Reading from stdin

This topic is governed by the same principles a the previous paragraph
(`Reading a file`), with the single difference that instead of the substitution
`"$(<file-path)"` the substitution that should be used is `"$(command arg1
...)"`, i.e.:

[source,zsh]
----
declare -a lines; lines=( ${(f)"$(command arg1 ...)"} )
----

This will read the `command's` output into the array `lines`. The version that
does `@` splitting and retains any empty lines is:

[source,zsh]
----
declare -a lines; lines=( "${(f@)$(command arg1 ...)}" )
----

Note that instead of four double-quotes `"`, an idiom that is justified (simply
suggested) by the Zsh documentation (and was used in the previous paragraph, in
the snippet `... "${(@f)"$(<path/file)"}" ...`), only **two** double-quotes are
being used. I've investigated this form with the main Zsh developers on the
`zsh-workers@zsh.org` mailing list and it was clearly stated that single,
outside quoting of `${(f@)...}` substitution works as if it was also separately
applied to `$(command ...)` (or to `$(<file-path)`) inner substitution, so the
second double-quoting isn't needed.

[#skipping-dirname-basename]
### Skipping dirname basename

`dirname` and `basename` can be skipped by:
[source,zsh]
----
local dirname="${PWD:h}"
local basename="${PWD:t}"
----
Read more about link:http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Modifiers[modifiers].

[#resolve-symlinks]
### Resolve Symlinks

Symbolic links can be turned into an absolute path with:
[source,zsh]
----
local absolute_path="${PWD:A}"
----

[#skipping-grep]
### Skipping grep

[source,zsh]
----
declare -a lines; lines=( "${(@f)"$(<path/file)"}" )
declare -a grepped; grepped=( ${(M)lines:#*query*} )
----

To have the `grep -v` effect, skip `M`-flag. To grep case-insensitively, use `\#i` glob
flag (`...:#(#i)\*query*}`).

As it can be seen, `${...:#...}` substitution is filtering of the array, which by
default filters-out elements (`(M)` flag induces the opposite behavior). When
used with string, not an array, it behaves similarly: returns empty string when
`{input_string_var:#pattern}` matches whole input string.

Side-note: `(M)` flag can be used also with `${(M)var#pattern}` and other
substitutions, to retain what's matched by the pattern instead of removing that.

[#multi-line-grep]
#### Multi-line matching like with grep

Suppose you have a Subversion repository and want to check if it contains files
being not under version control. You could do this in Bash style like follows:

[source,zsh]
----
local svn_status="$(svn status)"
if [[ -n "$(echo "$svn_status" | \grep \^\?)" ]]; then
    echo found
fi
----

Those are 3 forks: for `svn status`, for `echo`, and for `grep`. This can be solved
by the `:#` substitution and `(M)` flag described above in this section (just check
if the number of matched lines is greater than 0). However, there's a more direct
approach:

[source,zsh]
----
local svn_status="$(svn status)" nl=$'\n'
if [[ "$svn_status" = *((#s)|$nl)\?* ]]; then
  echo found
fi
----

This requires `extendedglob`. The `(#s)` means: "start of the string". So
`((#s)|$nl)` means "start of the string OR preceded by a new-line".

If the `extendedglob` option cannot be used for some reason, this can be
achieved also
without it, but essentially it means that alternative (i.e. `|`) of two
versions of the pattern will have to be matched:

[source,zsh]
----
setopt localoptions noextendedglob
local svn_status="$(svn status)" nl=$'\n'
if [[ "$svn_status" = (\?*|*$nl\?*) ]]; then
  echo found
fi
----

In general, multi-line matching falls into the following idiom (`extended glob
version):

[source,zsh]
----
local needle="?" required_preceding='[[:space:]]#'
[[ "$(svn status)" = *((#s)|$nl)${~required_preceding}${needle}* ]] && echo found
----

It does a single fork (calls `svn status). The `${~variable}` means (the `~`
init): "the variable is holding a pattern, interpret it". All in all, instead
of regular expressions we were using patterns (globs) (see
link:#built-in-regular-expressions-engine[this section]).

[#pattern-matching-in-and-fashion]
### Pattern matching in AND-fashion

[source,none]
----
[[ "abc xyz efg" = *abc*~^*efg* ]] && print Match found
----

The `~` is a negation -- `match \*abc* but not ...`. Then, `^` is also a negation.
The effect is: `\*ABC* but not those that don't have \*efg*` which equals to:
`\*ABC* but those that have also \*efg*`. This is a regular pattern and it can
be used with `:#` above to search arrays, or with the `R`-subscript flag to search
hashes (`${hsh[\(R)\*pattern*]}`), etc. The inventor of those patterns is Mikael
Magnusson.

[#skipping-tr]
### Skipping tr

[source,none]
----
declare -A map; map=( a 1 b 2 );
text=( "ab" "ba" )
text=( ${text[@]//(#m)?/${map[$MATCH]}} )
print $text ▶ 12 21
----

`#m` flag enables the `$MATCH` parameter. At each `//` substitution, `$map` is
queried for character-replacement. You can substitute a text variable too, just
skip `[@]` and parentheses in the assignment.

[#ternary-expressions-1]
### Ternary expressions with `+,-,:+,:-` substitutions

[source,none]
----
HELP="yes"; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} ▶ help enabled
HELP=""; print ${${HELP:+help enabled}:-help disabled} ▶ help disabled
----

Ternary expression is known from `C` language but exists also in Zsh, but
directly only in math context, i.e. `\(( a = a > 0 ? b : c ))`. Flexibility of
Zsh allows such expressions also in a normal context. Above is an example. `:+` is
"if not empty, substitute …" `:-` is "if empty, substitute …". You can save
a great number of lines of code with those substitutions, it's normally at least
4-lines `if` condition or lengthy `&&`/`||` use.

[#ternary-expressions-2]
### Ternary expressions with `:#` substitution

[source,none]
----
var=abc; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} ▶ is abc
var=abcd; print ${${${(M)var:#abc}:+is abc}:-not abc} ▶ not abc
----

A one-line "if var = x, then …, else …". Again, can spare a great amount of boring
code that makes a 10-line function a 20-line one.

[#built-in-regular-expressions-engine]
### Using built-in regular expressions engine

[source,none]
----
[[ "aabbb" = (#b)(a##)*(b(#c2,2)) ]] && print ${match[1]}-${match[2]} ▶ aa-bb
----

`\##` is: "1 or more". `(#c2,2)` is: "exactly 2". A few other constructs: `#` is
"0 or more", `?` is "any character", `(a|b|)` is "a or b or empty match". `#b`
enables the `$match` parameters. There's also `#m` but it has one parameter
`$MATCH` for whole matched text, not for any parenthesis.

Zsh patterns are a custom regular expressions engine. They are
slightly faster than the `zsh/regex` module (used for `=~` operator) and don't have
that dependency (regex module can be not present, e.g. in default static build
of Zsh). Also, they can be used in substitutions, for example in `//`
substitution.

[#skipping-uniq]
### Skipping uniq

[source,none]
----
declare -aU array; array=( a a b ); print $array ▶ a b
declare -a array; array=( a a b ); print ${(u)array} ▶ a b
----

Enable `-U` flag for array so that it guards elements to be unique, or use
`u`-flag to make unique elements of an array.

[#skipping-awk]
### Skipping awk

[source,none]
----
declare -a list; list=( "a,b,c,1,e" "p,q,r,2,t" );
print "${list[@]/(#b)([^,]##,)(#c3,3)([^,]##)*/${match[2]}}" ▶ 1 2
----

The pattern specifies 3 blocks of `[^,]##,` so 3 "not-comma multiple times, then comma", then the single block of "not-comma multiple times" in second parentheses --
and then replaces this with second parentheses. The result is the 4th column extracted
from multiple lines of text, something `awk` is often used for. Another method is
the use of `s`-flag. For a single line of text:

[source,none]
----
text="a,b,c,1,e"; print ${${(s:,:)text}[4]} ▶ 1
----

Thanks to in-substitution code-execution capabilities it's possible to use
`s`-flag to apply it to multiple lines:

[source,none]
----
declare -a list; list=( "a,b,c,1,e" "p,q,r,2,t" );
print "${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(s:,:)MATCH}[4]}}" ▶ 1 2
----

There is a problem with the `(s::)` flag that can be solved if Zsh is version
`5.4` or higher: if there will be single input column, e.g. `list=( "column1"
"a,b")` instead of two or more columns (i.e. `list=( "column1,column2" "a,b"
)`), then `(s::)` will return **string** instead of 1-element **array**. So the
index `[4]` in above snippet will index a string, and show its 4-th letter.
Starting with Zsh 5.4, thanks to a patch by Bart Schaefer (`40640: the (A)
parameter flag forces array result even if...`), it is possible to force
**array**-kind of result even for a single column, by adding `(A)` flag, i.e.:

[source,none]
----
declare -a list; list=( "a,b,c,1,e" "p,q,r,2,t" "column1" );
print "${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(As:,:)MATCH}[4]}}" ▶ 1 2
print "${list[@]/(#m)*/${${(s:,:)MATCH}[4]}}" ▶ 1 2 u
----

Side-note: `(A)` flag is often used together with `::=` assignment-substitution
and `(P)` flag, to assign arrays and hashes by-name.

[#searching-arrays]
### Searching arrays

[source,none]
----
declare -a array; array=( a b " c1" d ); print ${array[(r)[[:space:]][[:alpha:]]*]} ▶ c1
----

`\[[:space:]]` contains unicode spaces. This is often used in conditional
expression like `[[ -z ${array[(r)...]} ]]`.

Note that link:#skipping-grep[Skipping grep] that uses `:#` substitution can also be
used to search arrays.

### Code execution in `//` substitution

[source,none]
----
append() { gathered+=( $array[$1] ); }
functions -M append 1 1 append
declare -a array; array=( "Value 1" "Other data" "Value 2" )
declare -a gathered; integer idx=0
: ${array[@]/(#b)(Value ([[:digit:]]##)|*)/$(( ${#match[2]} > 0 ? append(++idx) : ++idx ))}
print $gathered ▶ Value 1 Value 2
----

Use of `#b` glob flag enables math-code execution (and not only) in `/` and `//`
substitutions. Implementation is very fast.

[#serializing-data]
### Serializing data

[source,none]
----
declare -A hsh deserialized; hsh=( key value )
serialized="${(j: :)${(qkv@)hsh}}"
deserialized=( "${(Q@)${(z@)serialized}}" )
print ${(kv)deserialized} ▶ key value
----

`j`-flag means join -- by spaces, in this case. Flags `kv` mean: keys and values,
interleaving. Important `q`-flag means: quote. So what is obtained is each key
and value quoted, and put into a string separated by spaces.

`z`-flag means: split as if Zsh parser would split. So quoting (with backslashes, double quoting, and others) is recognized. Obtained is array `( "key" "value")`
which is then de-quoted with `Q`-flag. This yields original data, assigned to
hash `deserialized`. Use this to e.g. implement an array of hashes.

Note: to be compatible with `setopt ksharrays`, use `[@]` instead of `(@)`, e.g.:
`...( "${(Q)${(z)serialized[@]}[@]}" )`

[#tip-serializing-with-bash]
#### Tip: serializing with Bash

[source,none]
----
array=( key1 key2 )
printf -v serialized "%q " "${array[@]}"
eval "deserialized=($serialized)"
----

This method works also with Zsh. The drawback is the use of `eval`, however, it's
impossible that any problem will occur unless someone compromises variable's
value, but as always, `eval` should be avoided if possible.

[#rworld-ex]
## Real world examples

[#git-subcmd-test]
### Testing for Git subcommand
Following code checks, if there is a `git` subcommand `$mysub`:

[source,none]
----
if git help -a | grep "^  [a-z]" | tr ' ' '\n' | grep -x $mysub > /dev/null > /dev/null; then
----

Those are `4` forks. The code can be replaced according to this guide:

[source,none]
----
local -a lines_list
lines_list=( ${(f)"$(git help -a)"} )
lines_list=( ${(M)${(s: :)${(M)lines_list:#   [a-z]*}}:#$mysub} )
if (( ${#lines_list} > 0 )); then
    …
fi
----

The result is just `1` fork.

[#unquoted-apostrophes-test]
### Counting unquoted-only apostrophes

A project was needing this to do some Zle line-continuation tricks (when you
put a backslash-\ at the end of the line and press enter – it is the
line-continuation that occurs at that moment).

The required functionality is: in the given string, count the number of
apostrophes, but _only the unquoted ones_. This means that only apostrophes
with null or an even number of preceding backslashes should be accepted into
the count:

[source,none]
----
buf="word'continue\'after\\\'afterSecnd\\''afterPair"
integer count=0
: ${buf//(#b)((#s)|[^\\])([\\][\\])#(\'\'#)/$(( count += ${#match[3]} ))}
echo $count ▶ 3
----

The answer (i.e. the output) to the above presentation and example is: `3`
(there are `3` unquoted apostrophes in total in the string kept in the variable
`$buf`).

Below follows a variation of the above snippet that doesn't use math-code execution:

[source,none]
----
buf="word'continue\'after\\\'afterSecnd\\''afterPair"
buf="${(S)buf//(#b)*((#s)|[^\\])([\\][\\])#(\'\'#)*/${match[3]}}"; buf=${buf%%[^\']##}
integer count=${#buf}
echo $count ▶ 3
----

This is possible thanks to `(S)` flag – non-greedy matching, `([\\][\\])#` trick – it
matches only unquoted following `(\'\'##)` characters (which are the apostrophes) and
a general strategy to replace `anything-apostrope(s)` (unquoted ones) with
`the-apostrope(s)` (and then count them with `${#buf}`).

## Tips and Tricks

[#parsing-ini-file]
### Parsing INI file

With Zshell's `extended_glob` parsing an `ini` file is an easy task. It will not
result in a nested-arrays data structure (Zsh doesn't support nested hashes),
but the hash keys like `$DB_CONF[db1_<connection>_host]` are actually really
intuitive.

The code should be placed in a file named `read-ini-file`, in `$fpath`, and
`autoload read-ini-file` should be invoked.
