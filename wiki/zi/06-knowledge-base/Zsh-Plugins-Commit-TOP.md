Plugins were evaluated on April 30th, 2022

There are so many plugins on the great [awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) page that
it makes sense to filter them out and also **score** them. The plugins below
contain 50 or more commits and are **evaluated** by an automatic script in order
to detect:

- ones with 100 or more commits
- active ones
- very active ones
- maintained ones
- ones having ongoing research & development

Just take a look at the iconography. It's intuitive and easy to memorize. In
minutes you'll be able to grep interesting plugins with your eyes!

## Iconography

### Devoted time and work detection

🥇 - has 100 or more commits

### Progress detection

🚶- slow/moderate progress: 1 commit in each of the last 3 months or 5 commits in total during the 3 last months (90 days)
🏃- fast progress: 2 commits in each of the last 3 months or 10 commits in total during the 3 last months

### Maintenance detection

⌛️- long time no update (updated not in last 3 months, but last 6 months)
⏳ - updated in last 3 months, active
⏰ - updated in the last month and month before it (a single new commit will not yield such a strong symbol as the alarm clock; the additional criterion ("a month before it") is to take into account only a more constantly attended projects)

### Research & development detection

💼 - has branches with at least 50 commits in total
📈 – the branches were active 3 times in the last 4 months
