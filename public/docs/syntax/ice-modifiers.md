Following ice modifiers are to be [passed](https://github.com/z-shell/zi/wiki/Alternate-Ice-Syntax/) to `zi ice...` to obtain described effects. The word `ice` means something that's added (like ice to a drink) – and in ZI it means adding a modifier to a next `zi` command, and also something that's temporary because it melts – and this means that the modification will last only for a **single** next `zi` command.

Some Ice-modifiers are highlighted and clicking on them will take you to the
appropriate Wiki page for an extended explanation.

You may safely assume given ice works with both plugins and snippets unless
explicitly stated otherwise.

### Cloning options

|        Modifier        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        `proto`         | Change protocol to `git`,`ftp`,`ftps`,`ssh`, `rsync`, etc. Default is `https`. **Does not work with snippets.**                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [**`from`**](Ice#from) | Clone plugin from given site. Supported are `from"github"` (default), `..."github-rel"`, `..."gitlab"`, `..."bitbucket"`, `..."notabug"` (short names: `gh`, `gh-r`, `gl`, `bb`, `nb`). Can also be a full domain name (e.g. for GitHub enterprise). **Does not work with snippets.**                               |
|         `ver`          | Used with `from"gh-r"` (i.e. downloading a binary release, e.g. for use with `as"program"`) – selects which version to download. Default is latest, can also be explicitly `ver"latest"`. Works also with regular plugins, checkouts e.g. `ver"abranch"`, i.e. a specific version. **Does not work with snippets.** |
|        `bpick`         | Used to select which release from GitHub Releases to download, e.g. `zi ice from"gh-r" as"program" bpick"*Darwin*"; zi load docker/compose`. **Does not work with snippets.**                                                                                                                                       |
|        `depth`         | Pass `--depth` to `git`, i.e. limit how much of history to download. **Does not work with snippets.**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|      `cloneopts`       | Pass the contents of `cloneopts` to `git clone`. Defaults to `--recursive`. I.e.: change cloning options. Pass empty ice to disable recursive cloning. **Does not work with snippets.**                                                                                                                             |
|       `pullopts`       | Pass the contents of `pullopts` to `git pull` used when updating plugins. **Does not work with snippets.**                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|         `svn`          | Use Subversion for downloading snippet. GitHub supports `SVN` protocol, this allows to clone subdirectories as snippets, e.g. `zi ice svn; zi snippet OMZP::git`. Other ice `pick` can be used to select file to source (default are: `*.plugin.zsh`, `init.zsh`, `*.zsh-theme`). **Does not work with plugins.**   |

### Selection of Files (To Source, …)

|                Modifier                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   [**`pick`**](Ice#src-pick-multisrc)   | Select the file to source, or the file to set as command (when using `snippet --command` or the ice `as"program"`); it is a pattern, alphabetically first matched file is being chosen; e.g. `zi ice pick"*.plugin.zsh"; zi load …`. |
|   [**`src`**](Ice#src-pick-multisrc)    | Specify additional file to source after sourcing main file or after setting up command (via `as"program"`). It is not a pattern but a plain file name.                                                                               |
| [**`multisrc`**](Ice#src-pick-multisrc) | Allows to specify multiple files for sourcing, enumerated with spaces as the separators (e.g. `multisrc'misc.zsh grep.zsh'`) and also using brace-expansion syntax (e.g. `multisrc'{misc,grep}.zsh'`). Supports patterns.            |

### Conditional Loading

|             Modifier              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      [**`wait`**](Ice#wait)       | Postpone loading a plugin or snippet. For `wait'1'`, loading is done `1` second after prompt. For `wait'[[ ... ]]'`, `wait'(( ... ))'`, loading is done when given condition is meet. For `wait'!...'`, prompt is reset after load. Zsh can start 80% (i.e.: 5x) faster thanks to postponed loading. **Fact:** when `wait` is used without value, it works as `wait'0'`. |
|  [**`load`**](Multiple-prompts/)  | A condition to check which should cause plugin to load. It will load once, the condition can be still true, but will not trigger second load (unless plugin is unloaded earlier, see `unload` below). E.g.: `load'[[ $PWD = */github* ]]'`.                                                                                                                              |
| [**`unload`**](Multiple-prompts/) | A condition to check causing plugin to unload. It will unload once, then only if loaded again. E.g.: `unload'[[ $PWD != */github* ]]'`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|            `cloneonly`            | Don't load the plugin / snippet, only download it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|               `if`                | Load plugin or snippet only when given condition is fulfilled, for example: `zi ice if'[[ -n "$commands[otool]" ]]'; zi load ...`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|               `has`               | Load plugin or snippet only when given command is available (in \$PATH), e.g. `zi ice has'git' ...`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   `subscribe` / `on-update-of`    | Postpone loading of a plugin or snippet until the given file(s) get updated, e.g. `subscribe'{~/files-*,/tmp/files-*}'`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          `trigger-load`           | Creates a function that loads the associated plugin/snippet, with an option (to use it, precede the ice content with `!`) to automatically forward the call afterwards, to a command of the same name as the function. Can obtain multiple functions to create – sparate with `;`.                                                                                       |

| :------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `silent` | Mute plugin's or snippet's `stderr` & `stdout`. Also skip `Loaded ...` message under prompt for `wait`, etc. loaded plugins, and completion-installation messages.                                                                                                                                          |
| `lucid`  | Skip `Loaded ...` message under prompt for `wait`, etc. loaded plugins (a subset of `silent`).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `notify` | Output given message under-prompt after successfully loading a plugin/snippet. In case of problems with the loading, output a warning message and the return code. If starts with `!` it will then always output the given message. Hint: if the message is empty, then it will just notify about problems. |

### Completions

|    Modifier     | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `blockf`     | Disallow plugin to modify `fpath`. Useful when a plugin wants to provide completions in traditional way. ZI can manage completions and plugin can be blocked from exposing them. |
| `nocompletions` | Don't detect, install and manage completions for this plugin. Completions can be installed later with `zi creinstall {plugin-spec}`.                                             |

### Command Execution After Cloning, Updating or Loading

|                     Modifier                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|                       `mv`                        | Move file after cloning or after update (then, only if new commits were downloaded). Example: `mv "fzf-* -> fzf"`. It uses `->` as separator for old and new file names. Works also with snippets.                                                                                                           |
|                       `cp`                        | Copy file after cloning or after update (then, only if new commits were downloaded). Example: `cp "docker-c* -> dcompose"`. Ran after `mv`.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [**`atclone`**](Ice#atclone-atpull-atinit-atload) | Run command after cloning, within plugin's directory, e.g. `zi ice atclone"echo Cloned"`. Ran also after downloading snippet.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [**`atpull`**](Ice#atclone-atpull-atinit-atload)  | Run command after updating (**only if new commits are waiting for download**), within plugin's directory. If starts with "!" then command will be ran before `mv` & `cp` ices and before `git pull` or `svn update`. Otherwise it is ran after them. Can be `atpull'%atclone'`, to repeat `atclone` Ice-mod. |
| [**`atinit`**](Ice#atclone-atpull-atinit-atload)  | Run command after directory setup (cloning, checking it, etc.) of plugin/snippet but before loading.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [**`atload`**](Ice#atclone-atpull-atinit-atload)  | Run command after loading, within plugin's directory. Can be also used with snippets.

Use with plugins that define **and use** aliases in their scripts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                    `light-mode`                    | Load the plugin without the investigating, i.e.: as if it would be loaded with the `light` command. Useful for the for-syntax, where there is no `load` nor `light` subcommand                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|            [**`extract`**](Ice#extract)            | Performs archive extraction supporting multiple formats like `zip`, `tar.gz`, etc. and also notably OS X `dmg` images. If it has no value, then it works in the _auto_ mode – it automatically extracts all files of known archive extensions IF they aren't located deeper than in a sub-directory (this is to prevent extraction of some helper archive files, typically located somewhere deeper in the tree). If no such files will be found, then it extracts all found files of known **type** – the type is being read by the `file` Unix command. If not empty, then takes names of the files to extract. Refer to the Wiki page for further information. |
|                      `subst`                       | Substitute the given string into another string when sourcing the plugin script, e.g.: `zi subst'autoload → autoload -Uz' …`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                     `autoload`                     | Autoload the given functions (from their files). Equvalent to calling `atinit'autoload the-function'`. Supports renaming of the function – pass `'… → new-name'` or `'… -> new-name'`, e.g.: `zi autoload'fun → my-fun; fun2 → my-fun2'`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Order of Execution

Order of execution of related Ice-mods: `atinit` -> `atpull!` -> `make'!!'` -> `mv` -> `cp` -> `make!` -> `atclone`/`atpull` -> `make` -> `(plugin script loading)` -> `src` -> `multisrc` -> `atload`.

## A Few Remarks

- The syntax automatically detects if the object is a snippet or a plugin, by
  checking if the object is an URL, i.e.: if it starts with `http*://` or
  `OMZ::`, etc.
- To load a local-file snippet (which will be treaten as a local-directory
  plugin by default) use the `is-snippet` ice,
- To load a plugin in `light` mode use the `light-mode` ice.
- If the plugin name collides with an ice name, precede the plugin name with
  `@`, e.g.: `@sharkdp/fd` (collides with the `sh` ice, ZI will take the
  plugin name as `sh"arkdp/fd"`), see the next section for an example.

## The Standard Syntax

The normal way of specifying ices and their values is by concatenating the ice
name and its value quoted, i.e.:

```zsh
zi wait"1" from"gh-r" atload"print Hello World"
zi load …
```

(note that there's no `ice` subcommand - that is currently being fully allowed)

## The Alternative Syntaxes

However, ZI supports also other syntaxes: the equal (`=`) syntax:

```zsh
zi wait=1 from=gh-r atload="print Hello World"
zi load …
```

the colon (`:`) syntax:

```zsh
zi wait:1 from:gh-r atload:"print Hello World"
zi load …
```

and also – in conjunction with all of the above – the GNU syntax:

```zsh
zi --wait=1 --from=gh-r --atload="print Hello World"
zi load …
```

## Summary

It's up to the user which syntax to choose. The original motivation behind the
standard syntax was: to utilize the syntax highlighting of editors like Vim –
and have the strings following ice names colorized with a distinct color and
this way separated from them. However, with the
[zi/zi-vim-syntax](https://github.com/z-shell/zi-vim-syntax)
syntax definition this motivation can be superseded with the ZI-specific
highlighting, at least for Vim.
